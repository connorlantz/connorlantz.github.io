												<h3>Scope</h3>
												<p>My office was in desperate need of a makeover. With three backpacks dedicated to different activities and a growing collection of hats from my travels, the clutter had taken over. To restore order and channel my CAD (computer-aided design) and 3D printing skills, I embarked on a mission to transform my workspace.</p>
												<p>The project's scope extended beyond just tidying up; it aimed to create a more productive environment. I've found that when my space is cluttered, my focus wanes. So, I decided to leverage CAD, 3D printing, and a touch of woodworking to revamp the office.</p>

												<h3>Design and Build</h3>
												<p>Adding a personal touch to my designs is a must. For the backpack hangers, I incorporated a twist on my future company's logo and motto. If all goes as planned, my company will be called Endeavor Engineering, and the logo consists of two back-to-back E's with the slogan "always innovate."</p>
												<p>The main challenge lay in ensuring everything was level and square. Given the small size and quick turnaround I aimed for, I didn't want to spend too much time perfecting these aspects. However, I learned that taking a bit more time for precision would be beneficial for future similar projects.</p>

												<h3>Methodology</h3>
												<ol>
													<li>Thoughtful design for functionality and aesthetics.</li>
													<li>3D printing of parts.</li>
													<li>Crafting wooden backpack hangers.</li>
													<li>Ensuring levelness and attaching to the wall.</li>
												</ol>

												<p>This project not only decluttered my office but also added an artistic touch. Each hat now carries its place of purchase, making it easier to keep everything organized. In the future, I'll continue seeking innovative solutions to maintain an orderly and visually appealing workspace.</p>
