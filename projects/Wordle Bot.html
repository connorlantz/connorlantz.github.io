												<p>During my computer science course, my fascination with the game Wordle led me to a unique challenge: programming a bot to solve Wordle puzzles. To start, I developed my own Wordle program, amassing a word bank of over 13,000 5-letter words from various sources, ensuring a diverse and challenging vocabulary. Yet, my own program proved to be a formidable opponent, prompting the creation of my Wordle bot.</p>
												<p>My initial bot attempted to guess words based on letter probabilities within the dictionary. However, it lacked the precision needed to consistently beat the game. The second iteration brought significant improvement. I began considering not only letter frequency but also letter placement in words. This allowed for more accurate word scoring based on probabilities, enhancing the bot's guessing strategy.</p>
												<p>Additionally, I incorporated gameplay strategy. In Wordle's easy mode, I identified that certain initial guesses, like 'bores,' 'canty,' and 'guild,' could effectively eliminate letters from the board. This strategic thinking was crucial.</p>
												<p>Coding challenges naturally arose, as they do in any programming project, often due to minor code errors. My limited experience in coding at the time necessitated the use of rudimentary functions. Nevertheless, this project taught me that basic tools and a well-thought-out strategy are sometimes all you need for success.</p>
												<p>In retrospect, this endeavor shed light on the importance of strategy development and perseverance in problem-solving. It also equipped me with valuable skills for tackling coding projects. While this Wordle bot project has evolved into more complex endeavors, like my Scrabble bot, it laid the foundation for my journey into the world of coding and automation.</p>
												<p>While it's been some time since I first created this Wordle bot, I've contemplated exploring similar challenges, such as creating a Quordle bot. Although other projects have taken precedence, I may revisit this intriguing domain in the future.</p>
												<p>If you are interested in trying out the code yourself, you can download the python script <a href="wordleBot2.py">here</a>! You will need to download the dictionary I amalgamated, linked <a href="wordleDictionary.txt">here</a> and put it in the same folder as the bot program. Note that it is written like a beginner. Hopefully the example below will be adequate instruction.</p>
