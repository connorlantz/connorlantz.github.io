									<p>A wine caddy is more than just a holder; it's a thoughtful gift that pairs style with function. In the spirit of family and celebration, I embarked on a project to design and craft personalized wine caddies. These caddies became special gifts for my loved ones, such as a 50th-anniversary surprise for my grandparents and a Porsche-themed caddy for my uncle.</p>
									<p>The scope of this endeavor was clear: create unique and personalized wine caddies for family members as heartfelt gifts. Armed with simple tools and a world of creativity, my mission was to craft showcase-worthy items that held both aesthetic appeal and sentimental value. The key features of these caddies included customized designs on wooden caddy exteriors, expertly accommodating two wine glasses alongside a cherished bottle of wine.</p>
									<p>Designing and crafting these caddies presented several challenges. Achieving sharp corners within the internal structure proved to be a meticulous task, demanding precision with a jigsaw and finesse with sandpaper. The labor-intensive nature of producing multiple caddies was another hurdle. Crafting smooth curves with a jig saw required patience and practice, while transferring designs from paper to wood for cutting was a meticulous process. Etching designs with a soldering iron, while creatively rewarding, introduced complexities due to harmful fumes and a learning curve.</p>

												<h3>Methodology</h3>
												<ol>
													<li>Utilize Power Point for initial caddy shape and design.</li>
													<li>Transfer design onto 1x6 wood using a printed template.</li>
													<li>Employ a jigsaw for cutting, drilling a central hole for internal cuts.</li>
													<li>Apply a Dremel for internal sanding and a rotary sander for external surfaces.</li>
													<li>Execute personalized designs using a soldering iron when required.</li>

											<p>The wine caddies were warmly received and continue to be proudly displayed to this day. I take pride in the craftsmanship poured into each caddy, with my father's assistance.</p>
											<p>This project revealed the labor-intensive nature of crafting caddies with basic tools, emphasizing the challenges of achieving sharp corners and executing intricate designs. The use of a soldering iron for design work introduced complexities due to harmful fumes and a steep learning curve.</p>
											<p>Looking ahead, I plan to invest in a CNC router, which will streamline the process by allowing precise and intricate designs with ease. I'll transition from using PowerPoint to utilizing Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software for the design phase, enhancing precision and complexity in my caddy creations. Additionally, a laser engraver is under consideration for etching designs into wood. The Snap Maker 2.0, a versatile 3-in-1 machine, is a potential solution that combines printing, CNC routing, and laser engraving capabilities, unlocking a world of creative possibilities.</p>
