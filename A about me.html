										<div class="col-7 col-12-medium">
											<p>Starting out as a wide-eyed student eager to make a mark, I’ve now progressed to my third year in civil engineering with a toolbox of skills and a stack of experiences. From my first efforts in courses like statics and materials to my current exploration of structural analysis and hydraulics, each lesson has contributed to my growing knowledge. I have discovered that civil engineering is not just about formulas and specifications; it’s about pushing the boundaries of our current infrastructure to be better than it ever has before.</p>
											<p>My passion for learning extends outside the classroom to the realm of personal projects. Whether it’s crafting a personal website in HTML to track my experiences and past endeavors or re-designing my backyard to work better with the existing topography, each project has brought a multitude of lessons with it. Through these undertakings, I’ve gained valuable skills in project management, timeline creation, budget allocation, idea generation, and more.</p>

										<div class="col-7 col-12-medium">
											<p>During my first work term at Winnipeg Traffic Signals, I dived into the world of traffic engineering and played a pivotal role in improving the consistency of intersection design. I helped author technical documents, including the Winnipeg Traffic Signals Design Guidelines, which helped streamline the design process and enhance the overall quality of signal installations. This experience not only honed my technical writing skills but also highlighted the importance of standards and guidelines in ensuring the safety and efficiency of urban infrastructure.</p>
											<p>My time at Dillon Consulting during my second work term was equally enriching. As part of their dynamic team, I had the opportunity to engage in hands-on activities that fueled my practical skills. I assisted in surveying for transportation projects, utilizing total station, GPS, and rod and level equipment. With these advanced instruments, I performed topographical surveys and translated design plans into layout for construction crews. Additionally, I gained valuable insight into the necessity for effective communication and management for large and impactful projects.</p>
											<p>As I look ahead into my last few years of school and beyond, I’m excited about the path that lies ahead. Internships, advanced coursework, and the opportunity to delve into more specialized areas of civil engineering await. Moreover, my curiosity drives me to explore the fascinating realm of structural engineering, where I aspire to contribute to the design and analysis of resilient and innovative structures. Additionally, I'm eager to immerse myself in the world of energy-efficient home building, seeking ways to merge sustainability with cutting-edge design. What's certain is that my DIY attitude, coupled with a love for learning, will continue to drive me forward as I strive to be a civil engineer who not only designs cool infrastructure but shapes better tomorrows.</p>

								<h2>Passions and Interests</h2>
								<p>Beyond the realm of civil engineering, my life is enriched by a variety of passions and interests that fuel my creativity and sense of purpose.</p>

												<h3>Design and Innovation</h3>
												<p>Design isn't merely a profession; it's a part of who I am. The thrill of crafting fresh and inventive interior spaces, landscapes, programs, contraptions, and more is where my heart truly lies. This passion for ongoing iteration and innovation seamlessly pairs with my aspirations as an engineer. To me, engineering embodies the intersection of creativity and functionality, and the prospect of embracing that balance for a lifetime is nothing short of exhilarating.</p>

												<h3>Community Engagement</h3>
												<p>My journey to this point has been significantly influenced by organizations like the <a href="https://lsrfmpb.ca/">Lord Selkirk RFM Pipe Band (LSRFMPB)</a>, a Winnipeg youth pipe band dedicated to introducing children to the world of bagpipes and drums. My involvement with LSRFMPB has enriched my life in numerous ways. It has led to the formation of lifelong friendships, the exploration of previously undiscovered passions, and a deep connection to the world of highland music. However, beyond these personal achievements, the true significance lies in my commitment to uplifting others within the organization. As the leading drum instructor at LSRFMPB and an active member of the Winnipeg Police Pipe Band, my motivation is driven by the desire to provide today’s youth with the same nurturing environment that I once found within the band.</p>

												<h3>Technology</h3>
												<p>Years of engaging in DIY projects have imparted a valuable lesson: using the right tool for the task maximizes efficiency. This philosophy has motivated me to explore cutting-edge technologies that empower me to channel my creativity in intricate ways. My introduction to 3D printing unlocked a world of possibilities, enabling rapid creation of custom hat hangers, adapters, and even an Iron Man helmet. Venturing into programming has been equally transformative, unveiling a range of applications, including designing solvers for word games like Wordle and Scrabble, as well as creating websites like this one. By immersing myself in emerging technologies, I not only enhance productivity but also embark on a continuous learning journey, igniting fresh ideas and innovative solutions.</p>

												<h3>Continuous Learning</h3>
												<p>A core dream of mine is to create a meaningful impact on our world. I believe I can achieve this by launching a company specializing in energy-efficient homes. In pursuit of this goal, I'm committed to constant learning – a vital step I believe will enhance my entrepreneurial skills. By immersing myself in various fields, I aim to build a comprehensive toolkit, empowering me to bring my vision to life.</p>

												<h3>Family</h3>
												<p>My family holds profound significance in my life. With a military background, I've journeyed across Canada, rarely residing near extended family. Precious moments with them are synonymous with a dream vacation. The briefest family visits become extraordinary, epitomizing the value of connection. Equally paramount is my immediate family's role. Their unparalleled support is a cornerstone, fostering my growth and resilience.</p>

												<h3>Music</h3>
												<p>My musical journey commenced at the age of 8 when my mom enrolled me in piano lessons. Since then, music has permeated every aspect of my life, providing support during both the highs and lows. It’s rare to find me not listening or playing music, my tastes span genres from pop and rock to country and even metal. Every piece of music has emotion behind it, and when I can connect with it, I feel on top of the world. The importance of music in my life has grown to the point where I can sit down at the piano and begin improvising full songs. My background in drumming further enables me to work with complex rhythms and write unique and groovy songs.</p>
